readme_file for frequency_of_words:

1st commit:
==========
      -> have initialized the given string 
      -> split the words in the given string and its become list
      -> sorting the list alphanumerically.
      -> initialized empty dictionary
      -> done the loop for str_split list
      -> each word verifies dictionary key if key is not there it assigns the value 1
      -> if already key is there in the dictionary the value incremented by one.
      -> dictionary converted as list
      -> for each element in the list it printed out.

issue on the first commit
=========================
dictionary does not have order.
done sorting initially. but added those into the dictionary in the for loop it may print
without sorting..

so done 2nd commit
====================
in the 2nd commit removed sort the list at initial
after converted the dictionary into the list, done the sorting by using sorted method.
so now it is print the elements with sorting order.

3rd commit
==========
in the 3rd commit created two different files
one is main function other one is only functions files.

here created 2 functions:
     1. frequency_of_words
     2. sorting order

frequency_of_words take the input from main function which is in other file and calculate the how many each word is there in the string
it results put into the dictionary.
sorting order take the input from the frequency_of_words i.e dictionary. it convert 
the dictionary into list and sorted out using sorted method.

main file
============
here just import the above two methods to here.
declared the main function
in the main function it is taking input of the string.
do split the string 
initializing the dictionary and calling frequency_of_words function
initializing the sort and calling sorting function
did the loop for soft and print the output.
